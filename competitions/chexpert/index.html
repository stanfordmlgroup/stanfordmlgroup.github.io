Automated chest radiograph interpretation at the level of practicing radiologists could provide substantial benefit in many medical settings, from improved workflow prioritization and clinical decision support to large-scale screening and global population health initiatives.
For progress in both development and validation of automated algorithms, we realized there was a need for a labeled dataset that (1) was large, (2) had strong reference standards, and (3) provided expert human performance metrics for comparison.</p></div><div class="col-md-5"><h2>Leaderboard</h2><p> Will your model perform as well as radiologists in detecting different pathologies in chest X-rays?</p><table class="table performanceTable"><tr><th>Rank</th><th>Date</th><th>Model</th><th>AUC</th><th>Num Rads Below Curve</th></tr><tr><td class="rank">1 <br></td><td><span class="date label label-default">Apr 06, 2019</span></td><td style="word-break:break-word;">muti_base (ensemble)<em> SCU_MILAB </em></td><td><b>0.907</b></td><td>1.6</td></tr><tr><td class="rank">1 <br></td><td><span class="date label label-default">Jan 23, 2019</span></td><td style="word-break:break-word;">Stanford Baseline (ensemble)<em> Stanford University </em><a class="link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07031">https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.07031</a></td><td>0.907</td><td>1.8</td></tr><tr><td class="rank">1 <br></td><td><span class="date label label-default">Mar 24, 2019</span></td><td style="word-break:break-word;">Naive Densenet<em> single model </em><a class="link" href="https://github.com/simongrest/chexpert-entries">https://github.com/simongrest/chexpert-entries</a></td><td>0.883</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td class="rank">1 <br></td><td><span class="date label label-default">Apr 24, 2019</span></td><td style="word-break:break-word;">Model_Team_34 (single model)<em> Gatech </em></td><td>0.850</td><td>0.60</td></tr><tr><td class="rank">1 <br></td><td><span class="date label label-default">Apr 24, 2019</span></td><td style="word-break:break-word;">singlehead_models (single model combined)<em> Gatech CSE6250 Team30 </em></td><td>0.842</td><td>0.20</td></tr><tr><td class="rank">1 <br></td><td><span class="date label label-default">Apr 24, 2019</span></td><td style="word-break:break-word;">multihead_model (one model for all pathologies)<em> Gatech CSE6250 Team30 </em></td><td>0.838</td><td>0.40</td></tr></table><h3>How can I participate?</h3><p>CheXpert uses a hidden test set for official evaluation of models.

We retrospectively collected the chest radiographic examinations from Stanford Hospital, performed between October 2002 and July 2017 in both inpatient and outpatient centers, along with their associated radiology reports.</p><h3>Label Extraction from Radiology Reports</h3><p>Each report was labeled for the presence of 14 observations as positive, negative, or uncertain. We decided on the 14 observations based on the prevalence in the reports and clinical relevance, conforming to <a href="https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.2462070712">the Fleischner Society’s recommended glossary </a>whenever applicable. We then developed an automated rule-based labeler to extract observations from the free text radiology reports to be used as structured labels for the images.</p><p>Our labeler is set up in three distinct stages: mention extraction, mention classification, and mention aggregation. In the mention extraction stage, the labeler extracts mentions from a list of observations from the <i>Impression</i> section of radiology reports, which summarizes the key findings in the radiographic study. In the mention classification stage, mentions of observations are classified as negative, uncertain, or positive. In the mention aggregation stage, we use the classification for each mention of observations to arrive at a final label for the 14 observations (<b>blank</b> for unmentioned, <b>0</b> for negative, <b>-1</b> for uncertain, and <b>1</b> for positive).</p><a class="btn btn-lg btn-default" href="https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/chexpert-labeler">Use the labeling tool</a></div><div class="col-md-5"><img src="/competitions/chexpert/img/table1.png"><img src="/competitions/chexpert/img/figure2.png"></div></div></div></section><section><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-7"><h2>What is our baseline model?</h2><p>We train models that take as input a single-view chest radiograph and output the probability of each of the 14 observations. When more than one view is available, the models output the maximum probability of the observations across the views.</p><h3>Leveraging Uncertainty Labels</h3><p> The training labels in the dataset for each observation are either 0 (negative), 1 (positive), or u (uncertain). We explore different approaches to using the uncertainty labels during the model training.</p><ul><li><b>U-Ignore</b>: We ignore the uncertain labels during training.</li><li><b>U-Zeroes</b>: We map all instances of the uncertain label to 0.</li><li><b>U-Ones</b>: We map all instances of the uncertain label to 1.</li><li><b>U-SelfTrained</b>: We first train a model using the U-Ignore approach to convergence, and then use the model to make predictions that re-label each of the uncertainty labels with the probability prediction outputted by the model.</li><li><b>U-MultiClass</b>: We treat the uncertainty label as its own class.</li></ul><p>We focus on the evaluation of 5 observations which we call the competition tasks, selected based of clinical importance and prevalence: (a) Atelectasis, (b) Cardiomegaly, (c) Consolidation, (d) Edema, and (e) Pleural Effusion.
 We compare the performance of the different uncertainty approaches on a validation set of 200 studies on which the consensus of three radiologist annotations serves as ground truth. Our baseline model is selected based on the best performing approach on each competition tasks on the validation set: U-Ones for Atelectasis and Edema, U-MultiClass for Cardiomegaly and Pleural Effusion, and U-SelfTrained for Consolidation.</p></div><div class="col-md-5"><img src="/competitions/chexpert/img/figure1.png"></div></div></div></section><section class="gray"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"><h2>How is the test designed?</h2><p> The test set consists of 500 studies from 500 unseen patients. Eight board-certified radiologists individually annotated each of the studies in the test set, classifying each observation into one of present, uncertain likely, uncertain unlikely, and absent. Their annotations were binarized such that all present and uncertain likely cases are treated as positive and all absent and uncertain unlikely cases are treated as negative.  
The majority vote of 5 radiologist annotations serves as a strong ground truth; the remaining 3 radiologist annotations were used to benchmark radiologist performance.<p>For each of the 3 individual radiologists and for their majority vote, we compute sensitivity (recall), specificity, and precision against the test set ground truth. To compare the model to radiologists, we plot the radiologist operating points with the model on both the ROC and Precision-Recall (PR) space. We examine whether the radiologist operating points lie below the curves to determine if the model is superior to the radiologists.</p></p></div></div></div></section><section><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"><h2>How well does the baseline model do on the test set?</h2><p>The model achieves the best AUC on Pleural Effusion (0.97), and the worst on Atelectasis (0.85). The AUC of all other observations are at least 0.9. On Cardiomegaly, Edema, and Pleural Effusion, the model achieves higher performance than all 3 radiologists but not their majority vote. On Consolidation, model performance exceeds 2 of the 3 radiologists, and on Atelectasis, all 3 radiologists perform better than the model.</p><img src="/competitions/chexpert/img/figure3.png"></div><div class="col-md-4"><img src="/competitions/chexpert/img/cams.png"></div></div></div></section><section class="gray"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-7"><h2>Bonus: Extra Dataset From MIT</h2><p>We're co-releasing our dataset with MIMIC-CXR, a large dataset of 371,920 chest x-rays associated with 227,943 imaging studies sourced from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2011 - 2016.

We hope that CheXpert will address that gap, making it easy to track the progress of models over time on a clinically important task.</p><p>Furthermore, we have developed and open-sourced the CheXpert labeler, an automated rule-based labeler to extract observations from the free text radiology reports to be used as structured labels for the images. We hope that this makes it easy to help other institutions extract structured labels from their reports and release other large repositories of data that will allow for cross-institutional testing of medical imaging models.</p><p>Finally, we hope that the dataset will help development and validation of chest radiograph interpretation models towards improving healthcare access and delivery worldwide.</p><!-- p - Jeremy Irvin, Pranav Rajpurkar, and Andrew Ng--></div><div class="col-md-5"><div class="media"><div class="media-left"><div class="feature-item"><img class="img-circle" src="/img/headshots/CurtLanglotz.jpg"/><h4 class="compact-title">Curt Langlotz</h4><p class="compact-subtitle">Professor of Radiology</p></div></div><div class="media-body"><p>In the U.S., about half of all radiology studies are x-rays, mostly of the chest.
