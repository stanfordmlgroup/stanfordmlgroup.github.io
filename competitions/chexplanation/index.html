                    <h1>What is CheXplanation?</h1>
                    <p>CheXplanation is a radiologist-annotated segmentation dataset on chest x-rays and
                        competition for automated pathology segmentation. The dataset can also be used for
                        evaluation of x-ray interpretation models.

                    <h2>Why CheXplanation?</h2>
                    <p> Chest radiography is the most common imaging examination globally, and is critical for
                        screening, diagnosis, and management of many life threatening diseases. While deep learning has
                        enabled automated medical imaging interpretation at a level shown to surpass that of practicing
                        experts, the “black box” nature of neural networks represents a barrier to physicians’ trust and
                        model adoption in the clinical setting. Therefore to promote clinical adoption it is crucial for
                        the model to be able to accurately identify regions and boundaries of pathologies in addition to
                        generate probabilistic outputs. For progress in both development and validation of automated
                        segmentation, we published a new radiologist-annotated segmentation dataset and established
                        expert human performance benchmark.

                    <p>CheXplanation uses a hidden test set with official evaluation of models. Teams submit their
                        segmentations per pathology which will be compared against the reference
                        segmentations. mIoU (mean intersection over union) will be used as the evaluation metric. </p>

                    <h2>How did we produce the CheXplanation dataset?</h2>
                    <p>The original chest x-rays came from CheXpert, a large public dataset for chest X-ray
                        interpretation. We provided pixel-level reference segmentations on the CheXpert validation and
                        test set from two board-certified radiologists who were asked to segment any of
                        the 10 pathologies that were present in each CXR as determined by the dataset’s ground-truth
                        labels. We also established a human benchmark by collecting segmentations
                        from three additional radiologists who were asked to segment the 10 pathologies of
                        interest present in each CXR as determined by the dataset’s ground-truth labels (there was no
                        overlap between these three radiologists and the two who drew the reference segmentations). The
                        ten competition tasks are:
                        Airspace Opacity, Atelectasis, Cardiomegaly, Consolidation, Edema, Enlarged Cardiomediastinum,
                        Lung Lesion, Pleural Effusion, Pneumothorax, and Support Devices.

                    <h2>Validation and Test Sets</h2>
                    <p> The CheXpert validation set consists of 234 chest X-rays from 200 patients randomly
                        sampled from the full dataset and was labeled according to the consensus of three
                        board-certified radiologists. The test set consists of 668 chest X-rays from 500 patients not
                        included in the training or validation sets and was labeled according to the consensus of five
                        board-certified radiologists. </p>
                    <p>We provided the reference segmentations and corresponding labels of the validation set. The test
                        set will be used as a held-out set for leaderboard evaluation and will only include the original
                        chest x-ray images.</p>
