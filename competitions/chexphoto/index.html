Most chest x-ray algorithms have been developed and validated on digital x-rays, while the vast majority of developing regions use films.
An appealing solution to scaled deployment is to leverage the ubiquity of smartphones for automated interpretation of film through cellphone photography. Automated interpretation of photos of chest x-rays at the same high-level of performance as with digital chest x-rays is challenging because photographs of x-rays introduce visual artifacts not commonly found in digital x-rays.
To encourage high model performance for this application,  we developed CheXphoto, a dataset of photos of chest x-rays and synthetic transformations designed to mimic the effects of photography.</p></div><div class="col-md-5"><h2>Leaderboard (coming soon)</h2><h3>How can I participate?</h3><p>CheXphoto measures model performance in relation to the CheXpert x-ray dataset. CheXphoto uses a hidden test set for official evaluation of models. Teams submit their executable code on Codalab, which is then run on a test set that is not publicly readable. Such a setup preserves the integrity of the test results.</p><p>Here's a tutorial walking you through official evaluation of your model. Once your model has been evaluated officially, your scores will be added to the leaderboard.</p><ul class="list-inline"><li><a class="btn btn-lg btn-default" href="https://worksheets.codalab.org/worksheets/0x693b0063ee504702b21f94ffb2d99c6d/">Submission Tutorial</a></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></section><section class="gray"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-7"><h2>How did we produce the CheXphoto dataset?</h2><p>CheXphoto comprises a training set of natural photos and synthetic transformations of 10,507 x-rays from 3,000 unique patients that were sampled at random from the CheXpert training set, and a validation and test set of natural and synthetic transformations applied to all 234 x-rays from 200 patients and 668 x-rays from 500 patients in the CheXpert validation and test sets, respectively.</p><h3>Natural Transformations Dataset</h3><p>Natural photos consist of x-ray photography using cell phone cameras in various lighting conditions and environments. We developed two sets of natural photos: images captured through an automated process using a Nokia 6.1 cell phone, and images captured manually with an iPhone 8.</p><h3>Synthetic Transformations Dataset</h3><p>Synthetic transformations consist of automatic changes to the digital x-rays designed to make them look like photos of digital x-rays and x-ray films. We developed two sets of complementary synthetic transformations: digital transformations to alter contrast and brightness, and spatial transformations to add glare, moiré effects and perspective changes.
To ensure that the level of these transformations did not impact the quality of the image for physician diagnosis, the images were verified by a physician. In some cases, the effects may be visually imperceptible, but may still be adversarial for classification models. For both sets, we apply the transformations to the same set of 10,507 x-rays selected for the Nokia10k dataset.</p><a class="btn btn-lg btn-default" href="https://github.com/stanfordmlgroup/cheXphoto">View on Github</a></div><div class="col-md-5"><img src="/competitions/chexphoto/img/distribution.png"><img src="/competitions/chexphoto/img/sample_images.png"></div></div></div></section><section><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-8"><h2>Validation and Test Sets</h2><p> We developed a CheXphoto validation and test set to be used for model validation and evaluation.
The validation set comprises natural photos and synthetic transformations of all 234 x-rays in the CheXpert validation set, and is included in the public release, while the test set comprises natural photos of all 668 x-rays in the CheXpert test set, and is withheld for evaluation purposes.</p><p>We generated the natural photos of the validation set by manually capturing images of x-rays displayed on a 2560×1080 monitor using a OnePlus 6 cell phone, following a protocol that mirrored the iPhone1k dataset. Synthetic transformations of the validation images were produced using the same protocol as the synthetic training set.
The test set was captured using an iPhone 8, following the same protocol as the iPhone1k dataset.</p></div></div></div></section><section class="gray"><div class="container"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-7"><h1>Downloading the Dataset (v1.0)</h1><p>Please read the Stanford University School of Medicine CheXphoto Dataset Research Use Agreement.
