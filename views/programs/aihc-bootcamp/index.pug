          h3 The AI for Healthcare Bootcamp provides students an opportunity to do cutting-edge research at the intersection of AI and healthcare. Over two quarters, students receive training from PhD students and faculty in the medical school to work on high-impact research problems in small interdisciplinary teams.
          p Projects resulting from the bootcamp have spanned multiple subspecialties (radiology, pathology, psychiatry, public health, metabolomics, bioengineering, embryology), problem formulations (diagnosis, prognosis, treatment, operations) and technologies (computer vision, natural language processing, causal inference). 
          p Collaborators include faculty at Stanford Medicine and Engineering, UCSF, and Harvard.

            h3 AI Specialization
            p This role is suited for students who have taken machine learning and software engineering courses. Students will be able to apply and sharpen these skills, developing machine learning solutions to challenging problems with the mentorship of CS PhD students and in collaboration with medical school faculty. Students have the opportunity to take a deep dive into healthcare and co-author a research paper. We expect students to have:
            ul
              li Taken machine learning courses (CS229/CS230/CS224N/CS231N or equivalent).
              li Proficiency in software engineering (CS107 or equivalent), and have done Python programming.
              li The bootcamp as their primary academic engagement (20-30 hours per week in lab) outside of 1 or 2 courses. We encourage students to sign up for research credits (CS 199, CS 399 etc).
            h3 Medicine Specialization
            p  This role is suited for students in the medical school. Students will work to define the focus of projects by exploring previous work and clinical utility. Students have the opportunity to work closely with the medical school faculty, take a deep dive into AI, and co-author a research paper. We expect students to:
            ul
              li Have medical knowledge / clinical experience (candidates have taken step 1 and/or completed at least some clinical rotations).
              li Know deep learning and machine learning at a conceptual level.
              li Dedicate 10-20 hours per week and attend 2 research meetings per week. Students can sign up for research credits (MED 199, MED 399 etc).
            h3 Deployment Specialization
            p AI projects are not complete before their tangible impact is demonstrated in the real world. This is why usable and robust deployment is a key element of our research projects.
            p This role is suited for students who have taken human computer interaction and software development courses. Students will be able to apply and sharpen these skills, developing solutions to challenging problems at the intersection of AI and healthcare with the mentorship of CS PhD students, medical school faculty and software industry experts. Students have the opportunity to take a deep dive into healthcare and co-author a research paper. We expect students to have:
            ul
              li Proficiency in Python, Linux, Cloud Computing and JavaScript
              li Have taken one or more of CS140, CS142, CS147, CS 193A, CS194H, CS210, or CS247
              li The bootcamp as their primary academic engagement (20-30 hours per week in lab) outside of 1 or 2 courses. We encourage students to sign up for research credits (CS 199, CS 399 etc).
