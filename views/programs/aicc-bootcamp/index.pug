          h3 The AI for Climate Change Bootcamp provides Stanford students an opportunity to do cutting-edge research at the intersection of AI and climate change. Students receive training from PhD students and bootcamp faculty to do interdiscplinary research on high impact problems.
          p 
            | Projects in the bootcamp have included work in (1) energy on detecting solar, wind, and oil and gas infrastructure in satellite imagery, (2) climate science on predicting methane emissions from natural wetlands, (3) deforestation on classifying the drivers of forest loss events using satellite imagery, and (4) transportation on detecting travel infrastructure in urban areas using street view imagery.

          h2 Program
          p 
            | The AICC bootcamp is an intense two-quarter program where students work on high-impact research problems at the intersection of AI and climate change. Students work closely with PhD students in Professor Andrew Ng's lab and with faculty members in earth science, energy, and urban planning. Students also collaborate with climate change experts from industry.

            h3 Prerequisites and Commitment
            p The bootcamp is suited for students who have taken machine learning and software engineering courses. Students will be able to apply and sharpen these skills, developing machine learning solutions to challenging problems with the mentorship of CS PhD students and in collaboration with faculty and industry experts. Students have the opportunity to take a deep dive into climate change and co-author a research paper. We expect students to have:
            ul
              li Taken machine learning courses (CS229/CS230/CS224N/CS231N or equivalent).
              li Proficiency in software engineering (CS107 or equivalent), and have done Python programming.
              li The bootcamp as their primary academic engagement (20-30 hours per week in lab) outside of 1 or 2 courses. We encourage students to sign up for research credits (CS 199, CS 399 etc).
            //- h3 Web Development Specialization
