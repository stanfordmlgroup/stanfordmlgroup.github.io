          h3 The AI for Climate Change Bootcamp provides Stanford students an opportunity to do cutting-edge research at the intersection of AI and climate change. Students receive training from PhD students and bootcamp faculty to do interdiscplinary research on high impact problems.
          p Projects in the bootcamp have included work in (1) energy on detecting solar, wind, and oil and gas infrastructure in satellite imagery, (2) earth science on predicting methane emissions from natural wetlands, (3) deforestation on classifying the drivers of forest loss events using satellite imagery, and (4) transportation on detecting travel infrastructure in urban areas using street view imagery.
          p Academic collaborators include faculty at Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment and Precourt Institute for Energy, UC Berkeley, and the University of Oxford.

          h2 Program
          p 
            | The AICC bootcamp is an intense two-quarter program where students work on high-impact research problems at the intersection of AI and climate change. Students work closely with PhD students in Professor Andrew Ng's lab and with faculty members in climate change-related fields. Students also collaborate with climate change experts from industry.
          p
            | The program includes teaching team and guest lectures on machine learning methods and tools and their application to climate change, as well as reading groups covering state-of-the-art research at the intersection of AI and climate change. Students learn about a variety of AI topics relevant to climate change with an emphasis on remote sensing applications.
