          h2 Program
          p 
            | The AICC bootcamp is an intense two-quarter program where students work on high-impact research problems at the intersection of AI and climate change (earth system science and energy). Students work closely with PhD students in Professor Andrew Ng's lab and with faculty in the 
            a(href="https://jacksonlab.stanford.edu/") Department of Earth System Science 
            | and the 
            a(href="http://web.stanford.edu/~ramr/index.html") Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering.

            h2 Applications
            p Students with a background in artificial intelligence are encouraged to apply. Applications for the 2019 Fall+Winter bootcamp will open in August.
            ul
              li Regular Applications due Sep 20th, 2019 at 11:59p PST.
              li Late Applications due Sep 25th, 2019 at 11:59p PST.
              li Rolling interviews and selections until Sep 27th, 2019.
              li Bootcamp starts October 1st, 2019. Students can choose to pursue a second quarter of the bootcamp in the Fall.
            h3 Prerequisites and Commitment
            p This bootcamp is suited for students who have taken machine learning and software engineering courses. Students will be able to apply and sharpen these skills, developing machine learning solutions to challenging problems with the mentorship of CS PhD students and in collaboration with earth system science and civil and environmental engineering faculty. Students have the opportunity to take a deep dive into climate change and co-author a research paper. We expect students to have:
            ul
              li Taken machine learning courses (CS229/CS230/CS224N/CS231N or equivalent).
              li Proficiency in software engineering (CS107 or equivalent), and have done Python programming.
              li The bootcamp as their primary academic engagement (30-40 hours per week in lab) outside of 1 or 2 courses. We encourage students to sign up for research credits (CS 199, CS 399 etc).
